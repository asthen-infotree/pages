<p><b>The Unexpected Genius of Being Bored</b>
In our always-on, always-connected world, boredom has become something we actively avoid. A spare moment on the train? Scroll through social media. Waiting for coffee? Check the news. A quiet evening at home? Stream another show. Our devices offer an endless buffet of distraction, keeping us constantly stimulated. But what if we're missing out on something vital by filling every single void? What if, believe it or not, boredom actually holds some surprising benefits?

However, a growing body of research suggests that allowing ourselves to be bored, even just for short bursts, can unlock some remarkable cognitive and creative superpowers.</p>
